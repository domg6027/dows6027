    <h1>About Derech Olam Warning Services</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Derech Olam Warning Services (DOW)</strong> exists to highlight unfolding world events 
      in light of the prophetic Scriptures. This platform is dedicated to sounding the alarm — not 
      from opinion or speculation, but from patterns already written in the Word of YHVH (יהוה), the 
      Creator of heaven and earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not speak for any denomination, organization, or movement. Our only alignment is with 
      truth, as revealed in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures and the fulfillment of prophecy across 
      history and into the present age.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name <strong>“Derech Olam”</strong> (דרך עולם) means <em>“The Eternal Path / The Way Everlasting.”</em> 
      It reflects our calling as watchmen to point people back to the Creator’s way in a time when 
      nations and systems are moving rapidly toward prophetic fulfillment.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a message of panic, but preparation. Not fear, but discernment. Our purpose is to 
      give every person — regardless of background — the opportunity to pause, consider, and seek 
      YHVH while He may be found.
    </p>

    <p><em>This is a watchman’s page.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Let those with eyes see, and those with ears hear.</strong></p>
